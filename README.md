# firefox_bookmark_to_sqlite3

Reads (via CLI) Firefox generated bookmarks (JSON created via export) and upserts into sqlite3 on Linux and Windows

Side notes (not too relavant to this project/workspace): This is a projected I worked on maybe 1.5-2 years ago that was on my local repos, and interestingly, when I git-merged by adding remote (via git remote add), I've lost my history (maybe it does exist, but I cannot find it).
